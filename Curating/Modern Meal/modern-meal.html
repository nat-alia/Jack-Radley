        <h3 class="title">The Modern Meal: Sustenance through Ritual</h3>
        <h5>April 7–August 6, 2017, The Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="writing-section writing-article" style="text-align: left; width: 675px; padding-top: 200px;">
<p>Our human need to eat
is universal; as a culture,
however, we hunger for something beyond food itself.
The Modern Meal: Sustenance through Ritual
examines visual representations of the meal and its role as a ritual
of consumption connected to location, resources, and
social organization. Historically mealtimes have been
determined by the workday, and dramatic changes in the
workplace—such as fixed work shifts in factories or offices
and, more recently, constant communication in the global
information economy—have contributed to transitions
in when, how, and what we eat. In their portrayals of the
meal, modern artists have reflected on these changes and probed themes of social equality, identity, globalization, and food availability. Many of the artworks included in this exhibition express the tension between real and imagined meal spaces, while others reveal the effects that labor, marginalization, and war can have on the very character of the meal. The Modern Meal highlights the spectrum of experiences, individual and shared, that are explored
across diverse artistic depictions of the meal.
To structure to the exhibition, we divided it into three
sections, each a dualism. These were inspired by the artist,
author, and activist Allan Sekula, who has theorized that
“labor is always shadowed by the absence of labor.”
<br><br>
Sekula here references the ways in which propagandistic images
that celebrate labor as an essential part of a prosperous
culture simultaneously imply “the shadow”—the threat (or
promise) of a society without work. “Place | Displacement”
illustrates how the spaces we occupy govern our daily
routines by emphasizing the mealtime rituals of those
displaced from their homes, either physically or psychologically. “Plenitude | Scarcity” considers not only the
apportioning of food, but also the ways in which interactions between those at the table manifest power dynamics
and degrees of privilege. “Freedom | Regimentation”
addresses the roles of gender and labor in organizing meal
times and spaces. By exploring the consumer, the setting,
and the food in proximity,
these three sections
suggest the
complexity of this apparently simple social form.
The Modern Meal: Sustenance through Ritual
examines how
the meal’s temporal, spatial, and social qualities are as
important as the food in determining what constitutes the
meal. There has been a long history of food in visual art,
from the religious iconography of Leonardo da Vinci’s
The
Last Supper
to the references to consumer culture in Andy
Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans

A variety of art exhibitions in the past decade have addressed food and meals,
including examinations of the kitchen as a site of social
production and the meal as a performative exchange
between host and diner.

In contrast to these approaches,
we seek to consider the meal itself as a ritualized performance in order to understand the kind of sustenance we
seek from shared meals. This spectrum of experiences at
the table can in turn expose the underlying politics of the
meal, on an individual, interpersonal, and global scale.

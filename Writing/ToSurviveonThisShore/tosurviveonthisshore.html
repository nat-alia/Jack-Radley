        Artist Jess T. Dugan and social worker Vanessa Fabbre’s To Survive on This Shore documents the vibrancy and plurality of transgender and gender nonconforming elders across the United States. The projects’ various incarnations – as exhibition and book, across social media and academia – bring the stories of their subjects to a multiplicity of audiences.  The individuals in To Survive on This Shore do not perform a position, but rather give testimony to the triumphs and vicissitudes of their lives, their relationships, and their identities.  The authors center the project – which combines photographic portraiture and anthropology – on the voices of the 86 different people whom they met throughout their travels across the United States for over five years. While older trans and gender nonconforming people are underrepresented in our culture, Dugan and Fabbre’s project attests to the longevity of the trans community and speaks to the spectrum of experiences at the intersection of gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, sexuality, socioeconomic class, and geography.

      <p>
        I spoke with Jess T. Dugan about the project’s conceptual aim and practical methodology, her approach to image-making, and the ethics behind creating a dignified portrait. Dugan holds an MFA in Photography from Columbia College Chicago, a Master of Liberal Arts in Museum Studies from Harvard, and a BFA in Photography from Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She has exhibited at venues including Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Aperture Foundation, and Museum of Contemporary Photography. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Museum of Contemporary Photography, Harvard Art Museums, and Saint Louis Art Museum, among others.

      <span class="speaker">Jack Radley:</span> Let’s discuss To Survive on This Shore. How did the project begin, and how has grown over the last 5 years?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="speaker">Jess T. Dugan:</span> Prior to making To Survive on This Shore, I had been photographing within LGBTQ communities and making work that explored issues of identity, including gender and sexuality, for many years. In 2012, I met my partner, Vanessa Fabbre, a social worker whose research focuses on the intersection of LGBTQ communities and aging. Even though we were in different fields, we realized we had overlapping interests, so we decided to work on this project together, with me making the photographs and her conducting and editing the interviews. From the beginning, we conceived of it as both an exhibition and a book.
      </p>

      <p>
        We made the first portraits in 2013. We started with people that we had known from our previous work within trans communities, particularly in Boston, where I had lived, and in Chicago, where Vanessa and I had lived and worked for a long time. For the next two years, we made portraits and interviews as we were able and as we traveled. The project spread through word of mouth over the five years we were working on it. Each person we photographed would end up telling other people, and they would get in touch and want to participate.
      </p>

      <p>
      In early 2015, we had about 25 portraits and interviews and created a website. We got a flurry of press that was kicked off by a feature in the New York Times. That press moment was really significant for identifying subjects all around the country. After that feature went live, I received more than 100 emails from people all around the country who wanted to participate.
      </p>

      <p>
      Our personal connections to subjects, as well as the passage of time, were significant to identifying subjects. I also attended several trans conferences around the country, particularly the Trans Wellness Conference in Philadelphia and the Gender Odyssey Conference in Seattle. I reached out to LGBTQ nonprofit organizations as I would travel for my other ongoing work and they would connect me with individuals in that community whom they thought were a good fit for the project. Finding and meeting subjects was a multi-pronged approach. We certainly had people reach out to us who wanted to participate, but we also sought out people within the community who were significant as activists or leaders.
      </p>

      <p>
      From a more conceptual point of view, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted to include a diverse group of subjects in the project. We sought diversity in terms of age, race and ethnicity, gender identity and expression, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and life narrative. We went across the country and ended up photographing and interviewing 86 people over a five-year period. We were very intentional about going to places that are not often thought of as being places that have large LGBTQ populations, such as the rural South, the Midwest, etc.
